    <h3>GMP</h3>
    <p>GMP is a system to ensure products are consistently produced and controlled according to quality standards. It is designed to minimize the risks involved in any pharmaceutical production that cannot be eliminated through testing the final product. A directive circular issued by the Ministry of Health in Jul 95 marked the official launch of GMP certification in China. The China Certification Committee for Drugs (CCCD) was established in the same year. A subsidiary organization was also set up to manage the certification program.</p>
    <p>Currently nine government agencies are the key agencies responsible for regulation. They are the State Food and Pharmaceutical Administration (SFDA), the State Development and Reform Committee, the Commerce Ministry, the State Traditional Chinese Medicine Administration, the Ministry of Labor and Social Security, the Ministry of Health, the State Population and Family Planning Committee, the Ministry of Science and Technology, and the State Quality and Technology Supervision Administration.</p>
    <p>In addition, more than 10 industrial associations also regulate the industry.</p>

    <h3>T&Uuml;V</h3>
    <p>
      T&Uuml;Vs (German pronunciation: [?t?f]) (short for Technischer
      &Uuml;berwachungs-Verein, Technical Inspection Association in English) are
      German organizations that work to validate the safety of products of
      all kinds to protect humans and the environment against hazards. As
      independent consultants, they examine plants, motor vehicles, energy
      installations, devices and products (e.g consumer goods) which require
      monitoring. The many subsidiaries of the T&Uuml;Vs can also act as project
      developers for energy and traffic concepts, as problem solvers in
      environmental protection, and as certification bodies. Many of the T&Uuml;V
      organizations also provide certification for various international
      standards, such as ISO9001:2008 (quality management system) and
      ISO/TS16949 (automotive quality management system).

   <h3>ISO 14000</h3>
   <p>
    The ISO 14000 is a standard for environmental management systems
    that is applicable to any business, regardless of size, location or
    income. The aim of the standard is to reduce the environmental
    footprint of a business and to decrease the pollution and waste a
    business produces. The most recent version of ISO 14001 was released in
    2004 by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) which
    has representation from committees all over the world. The ISO 14000
    environmental management standards exist to help organizations minimize
    how their operations negatively affect the environment. In structure it
    is similar to ISO 9000 quality management and both can be implemented
    side by side. In order for an organization to be awarded an ISO 14001
    certificate they must be externally audited by an audit body that has
    been accredited by an accreditation body. In the UK, this is UKAS.
    Certification auditors need to be accredited by the International
    Registrar of Certification Auditors. The certification body has to be
    accredited by the Registrar Accreditation Board in the USA, or the
    National Accreditation Board in Ireland.<br />

    <h3>ISO 19001</h3>
    <p>ISO 19001 specifies requirements for information supplied by the
    manufacturer with reagents used in staining in biology. It applies to
    producers, suppliers and vendors of dyes, stains, chromogenic reagents
    and other reagents used for staining in biology. The requirements for
    information supplied by the manufacturer specified in ISO 19001are a
    prerequisite for achieving comparable and reproducible results in all
    fields of staining in biology.</p>

    <h3>CSA</h3>
<p>
International (Canadian Standards Association), a member of the CSA
Group, is a provider of product testing and certification services for
electrical, mechanical, plumbing, gas and a variety of other products.
Recognized in the U.S., Canada and around the world, CSA&rsquo;s marks appear
on billions of products worldwide.<br />
CSA International certification marks indicate that a product, process
or service has been tested to a Canadian or U.S. standard and it meets
the requirements of an applicable CSA standard or another recognized
document used as a basis for certification.<br />
For consumers, CSA International certification marks are intended to
provide increased assurance of quality and safety. For manufacturers,
international recognition of the mark may help to ease their entry into
North American markets. CSA International certification marks are
accepted by many North American regulators and by a large number of
North American retailers. Billions of products bearing CSA
International certification marks are found on the shelves of
well-known retail chains and sold by major product distributors.<br />
CSA International tests products for the North American and
International markets against applicable standards including those of
the Canadian Standards Association (CSA), Underwriters Laboratories
(UL), NSF National Sanitation Foundation (NSF), American National
Standards Institute (ANSI) and other agencies.</p>
